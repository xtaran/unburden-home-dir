Description: Remove or move cache files automatically from user's home
 unburden-home-dir allows users to move cache files from browsers,
 etc. off their home directory, i.e. on a local harddisk or tmpfs and
 replace them with a symbolic link to the new location (e.g. on /tmp/
 or /scratch/) upon login. Optionally the contents of the directories
 and files can be removed instead of moved.
 .
 This is helpful at least in the following cases:
 .
 The idea-giving case are big workstation setups where $HOME is on NFS
 and all those caches put an unnecessary burden (hence the name) on
 the file server since caching over NFS doesn't have the best
 performance and may clog the NFS server, too.
 .
 A similar case, but with different purpose is reducing I/O on mobile
 devices like laptops or netbooks to extend the battery life or reduce
 the wearing down of CF or SD cards, e.g. in single board computers
 like the Raspberry Pi or Alix or APU boards: Moving browser caches
 etc. off the real disk into a tmpfs filesystem reduces the amount of
 disk I/O which reduces the power consumption of the disk.
 .
 Another possible solution for saving non-crucial I/O is using the
 package eatmydata to ignore a software's fsync calls.
 .
 The other type of use cases for unburden-home-dir is to reduce disk
 space usage, e.g. on devices with small disk space but a lot of RAM
 as seen often on boxes with flash disks or early netbooks, e.g.  the
 first EeePC with 4GB disk space and 2GB RAM. In this case you want to
 move off as many cache files, etc. as possible to some tmpfs
 filesystem, e.g. /tmp/.
 .
 It may also help to reduce the amount of needed backup disk space by
 keeping those files in places where they don't get backed up. In that
 case it's an alternative to keeping the blacklist in your backup
 software up-to-date.
 .
 For some users it may also be helpful to stay under their quota.
 .
 The package also contains an Xsession hook which calls this script on
 X login for every user. But by default no files or directories are
 configured to be moved elsewhere, so nothing will happen
 automatically without configuration.
